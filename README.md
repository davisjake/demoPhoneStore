# demoPhoneStore
demo application of a cell phone store with user authentication and cart
Tools: Ionic and Firebase for backend
Project:
1. Allow authenticated signups, with email confirmation, and logins through a signup
page and login page, respectively.
2. Once logged in, a user can view 5 different cell phones and associated pictures, with a
list (or small cards) of models, serial numbers, and price. The list is dynamically
requested from the database, not hardcoded.
3. As the user taps on one of the models, the user is taken to a page that shows the
details of the phone: at least two pictures, manufacturer, serial number, price, year
introduced, features, and a short paragraph description. A “Buy” button is shown at
the bottom of the description.
4. When the user taps on “Buy,” a pop-up message tells the user that model is added to
the cart.
5. The user can add more models if necessary.
6. The user then taps on a cart icon (hidden menu or floating on the page) that takes the
user to the cart with all the models that were tapped to purchase.
7. The cart page shows the total, amount, and short description of the product(s).
